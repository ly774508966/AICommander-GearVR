Description:
	AICommander is designed in Unity for Googles Daydream VR. 
	Since I didn't have access to Daydream VR hardware (it wasn't yet released) I made a Gear VR 
	version with a controller (similar to the Playstation controller) to test out the game.
	
How to run:
	Load the project into Unity and build to a Samsung Gear VR compatible device. Then just insert
	that device into your Gear VR.
